# Introduction to Azure Machine Learning service
This series of labs introduces core features of Azure Machine Learning service and demonstrates how AML service can be used to orchestrate machine learning workflows. The labs  walk you through the key phases of a machine learning workflow: from data preparation, through model selection and tuning, to model operationalization.


## Lab environment set up

The Azure Machine Learning service is platform agnostic. The only requirements for your development environment are Python 3, Conda (for isolated environments), and a configuration file that contains your Azure Machine Learning workspace information.

The following development environments are supported: 
- **Azure Notebooks**
- **The Data Science Virtual Machine**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Visual Studio**
- **PyCharm**
- **Azure Databricks**

In this workshop we will use **Azure Notebooks** as a development environment.

### To set up Azure Notebooks

1. Navigate to: https://notebooks.azure.com

2. Log in with the same credentials you use for Azure Portal.

3. Navigate to **My Projects** page.

4. Click on **Upload Github Repo**

5. Configure the form as on the below picture
